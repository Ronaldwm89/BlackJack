# BlackJack
Blackjack in Python üÉè
This is one of my first projects in Python programming. It‚Äôs a simple Blackjack game created as part of my initial learning process. The code is quite basic and can be significantly improved, as it reflects my early steps in programming. I hope this project serves both to show my progress and to help other beginners learn from it.

# Project Description
The game simulates a Blackjack game between a player and the computer. It includes:

A deck of cards with the four standard suits: ‚ô•Ô∏è, ‚ô¶Ô∏è, ‚ô†Ô∏è, ‚ô£Ô∏è.
Functionality to automatically calculate card values (including aces as 1 or 11, depending on the situation).
Logic for the player to choose whether to take another card or stop.
Basic AI behavior for the computer.
Result verification: who wins, who loses, or if there's a tie.
Features

## Learning in Action: 
This project was developed as part of my early lessons in Python.

## Basic Blackjack Logic: 
It includes most of the fundamental rules of the game.

## Dynamic Simulation: 
Played cards are removed from the deck to ensure fair play.
How to Play

Run the Python file in your terminal.
Answer S or N when asked if you want to play.
Enjoy a match against the computer. Choose whether to take a card or stop, but be careful not to go over 21!

# Important Notes

This code is not optimized and may contain errors. It reflects my early steps in programming, so feedback and suggestions for improvement are welcome.

Feel free to modify or improve the functionality if you decide to use this code.

# Future Steps
In the future, I plan to:

Improve the code structure by applying Object-Oriented Programming concepts.
Implement a graphical user interface.
Add more advanced Blackjack rules, such as splitting or betting.
